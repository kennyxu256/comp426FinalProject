# comp426FinalProject
Final Project for UNC Comp 426. I made a typing game complete with a user/login backend in a Python bottle app.
You can sign in to track your best WPM and try to top your personal best. Typing prompts are grabbed from a 
random quote generator API, and the game checks for case sensitivity and doesn't count incorrect characters.
